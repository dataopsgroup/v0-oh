    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Lead scoring is one of the most powerful features in HubSpot, yet most companies barely scratch the surface of its potential. A well-designed lead scoring model can transform your sales efficiency and dramatically improve conversion rates.</p>
    
    <h2>The Foundation: Understanding Your Ideal Customer</h2>
    <p>Before building any scoring model, you need crystal-clear understanding of your ideal customer profile (ICP). This goes beyond basic demographics to include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Behavioral patterns of your best customers</li>
      <li>Common pain points and triggers</li>
      <li>Typical buyer journey stages</li>
      <li>Decision-making processes</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Advanced Scoring Categories</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Demographic Scoring (30% weight)</h3>
    <p>Traditional firmographic data remains important:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Company size and revenue</li>
      <li>Industry and vertical</li>
      <li>Geographic location</li>
      <li>Job title and seniority</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>2. Behavioral Scoring (50% weight)</h3>
    <p>This is where the magic happens:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Website engagement depth and frequency</li>
      <li>Content consumption patterns</li>
      <li>Email engagement rates</li>
      <li>Social media interactions</li>
      <li>Event attendance and participation</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>3. Negative Scoring (20% weight)</h3>
    <p>Don't forget to subtract points for disqualifying factors:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Competitor email domains</li>
      <li>Students or job seekers</li>
      <li>Unsubscribe behaviors</li>
      <li>Spam-like activity patterns</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Implementation Best Practices</h2>
    
    <h3>Start Simple, Then Iterate</h3>
    <p>Begin with a basic model and refine based on actual performance data. Track conversion rates by score ranges and adjust accordingly.</p>
    
    <h3>Set Clear Thresholds</h3>
    <p>Define specific score ranges for different actions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>0-25: Cold leads (nurture only)</li>
      <li>26-50: Warm leads (marketing qualified)</li>
      <li>51-75: Hot leads (sales qualified)</li>
      <li>76-100: Priority leads (immediate follow-up)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Align Sales and Marketing</h3>
    <p>Regular feedback loops between teams are essential. Monthly reviews should include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Conversion rate analysis by score range</li>
      <li>Sales feedback on lead quality</li>
      <li>Adjustments to scoring criteria</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Advanced Techniques</h2>
    
    <h3>Time Decay Scoring</h3>
    <p>Implement time-based score decay to ensure recent activity is weighted more heavily than old interactions.</p>
    
    <h3>Progressive Profiling Integration</h3>
    <p>Use progressive profiling data to continuously refine and improve scoring accuracy.</p>
    
    <h3>Multi-Touch Attribution</h3>
    <p>Consider the entire customer journey, not just the last touch before conversion.</p>
    
    <h2>Measuring Success</h2>
    <p>Track these key metrics to evaluate your lead scoring effectiveness:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lead-to-opportunity conversion rates by score range</li>
      <li>Sales cycle length for different score tiers</li>
      <li>Customer lifetime value correlation with initial scores</li>
      <li>Sales team satisfaction with lead quality</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>A pro-level lead scoring model is never "finished" â€“ it's a living system that evolves with your business. The key is to start with solid fundamentals, measure everything, and continuously optimize based on real performance data.</p>
