    <p>Learn how we created order that boosted business. HubSpot went from a problem to a positive addition.</p>
    
    <p>The client is a decades-old manufacturer of upscale home improvement products. They have a network of authorized dealers. These dealers sell the products and work with contractors who install them for homeowners.</p>
    
    <p>The head of marketing joined the business after HubSpot had been in use for a while. He discovered that many attempts to date aimed to capture as much value and insight as possible. Unfortunately, these efforts clogged the system so bad that it could not help him improve the business.</p>
    
    <p>The HubSpot engagement began by fixing certain forms intended to bring leads into HubSpot. Getting leads into HubSpot was their primary pain point then. After investigating, we found that the website forms were not HubSpot forms. They were not connected to HubSpot either.</p>
    
    <p>We exported the leads trapped in the CMS and imported these to HubSpot. His sales team focused on this backlog to contact homeowners and dealers for follow up. We worked with their web agency to replace all non-HubSpot forms with embedded HubSpot forms.</p>
    
    <p>This resulted in leads flowing into the system to the right salespeople in a timely manner. This resolution was an immediate win within a few days.</p>
    
    <p>Further inspection of the client's HubSpot revealed many other issues.</p>
    
    <p>Hundreds of leads sat assigned to salespeople no longer with the company. These were immediately reassigned to the current, correct salesperson. Many contacts were not correctly as the right persona type which made email marketing segmentation difficult. Landing pages for events that were in the past were still live. Some forms still sent notifications to departed employees or to employees who did not need the notification as part of their work.</p>
    
    <p>The client and I built a new territory map based on US ZIP codes. A new global workflow now sorted form submissions to the correct salesperson. Forms were updated to collect the right data points so all new, incoming conversions were not only assigned correctly but tracked for weekly volume. Such reporting capabilities were an unexpected and delightful surprise for the client.</p>
    
    <p>We reprocessed the entire database to assign the right owners. Each salesperson now received internal notifications within minutes when assigned a new contact. Tasks created for a follow-up process drove awareness of missed opportunities.</p>
    
    <p>Reporting gave management visibility into how each salesperson managed their tasks. This is a large workflow that continues to empower sales efforts. And it is both robust and agile enough that we can adjust it when salespeople leave or join the company.</p>
    
    <p>We built many marketing campaigns to support their private events. This included sending invitations and reminders. The client used both email and SMS, too. Reporting was provided for these as well since their events were in-person and they needed to monitor headcount for planning purposes.</p>
    
    <p>The client's use of our talents grew to include updating their online product catalogs, too. The current flip page tool did not support HubSpot integrations. The client required users to register for access. We worked once more with the web agency on a fix. We installed a better flip page tool. Now leads register for access to view catalogs plus request hard copies sent to their homes. And their correct data goes into the CRM.</p>
    
    <p>Further work included:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Ongoing data and systems maintenance</li>
      <li>New integrations</li>
      <li>Advising on strategy and technologies to achieve goals, and</li>
      <li>Support to internal users for specific issues</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The relationship is an ongoing success.</p>
