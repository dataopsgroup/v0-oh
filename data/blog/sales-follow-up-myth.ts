    <p>"We spend $5,000 per month on marketing and acquired 10 new customers this month, so our CAC is $500."</p>
    
    <p>If your sales team is still following the "respond within 72 hours" guideline, you're losing 98% of your potential deals before they even start. According to groundbreaking research from Lead Response Management, the odds of contacting a lead decrease by over 10x after the first hour—and the odds of qualifying that lead decrease by 6x.</p>
    
    <p>Even more shocking? InsideSales.com found that 35-50% of sales go to the vendor that responds first. Not the best product. Not the lowest price. The first responder.</p>
    
    <p>Yet HubSpot Research reveals that the average company takes 42 hours to respond to leads. During that time, your prospect has either found a competitor or lost interest entirely.</p>
    
    <p>The data gets more concerning when examining response timing by channel:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Web form submissions: The average response time is 17 hours, but conversion rates drop by 80% after just 5 minutes</li>
      <li>Chat inquiries: 42% go unanswered for over 24 hours</li>
      <li>Social media inquiries: An average 10-hour response time, with each hour reducing conversion probability by 7%</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This isn't just a sales problem—it's a systems problem. Gartner research indicates that companies with automated lead routing and notification systems achieve 30% higher conversion rates. The difference isn't sales skill; it's response architecture.</p>
    
    <p>The solution lies in creating intelligent workflows in your CRM system. HubSpot's automation capabilities can route leads to the right sales rep instantly, send notifications to mobile devices, and even deploy personalized outreach sequences automatically when human response isn't possible.</p>
    
    <p>Our Sales Performance Reports track response times across your team, identifying gaps in your follow-up process that are causing valuable leads to slip through the cracks. We can build a comprehensive response system that ensures no lead ever waits more than 5 minutes for acknowledgment.</p>
