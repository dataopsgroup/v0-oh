    <h2>Why CRM Cleanup Matters</h2>
    
    <p>A cluttered CRM is more than just annoying—it's a liability. Inaccurate or outdated records lead to poor customer experiences, missed opportunities, and wasted resources.</p>
    
    <p>Salesforce's CRM Report reveals that 88% of CRMs contain critical data issues. Here's how to fix it—fast.</p>
    
    <p>Poor CRM data quality impacts everything from <a href="/insights/customer-segmentation-mistake">customer segmentation accuracy</a> to <a href="/insights/customer-churn-blindspot">churn prediction capabilities</a>. Without clean data, you're making business decisions based on incomplete or incorrect information.</p>
    
    <h3>Days 1–30: Assessment & Planning</h3>
    
    <p>Start by laying the foundation for success. Use this time to understand the current state of your CRM and set goals.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Audit Data Quality</strong> – Identify duplicates, incomplete fields, and outdated records.</li>
      <li><strong>Document Current State</strong> – Take a snapshot of your CRM's structure, fields, and segmentation.</li>
      <li><strong>Set Cleanup Goals</strong> – Define what success looks like (e.g., 90% accuracy, no duplicates).</li>
      <li><strong>Create Governance Rules</strong> – Establish rules for data entry, maintenance, and permissions.</li>
      <li><strong>Assign Responsibilities</strong> – Ensure accountability by assigning cleanup owners.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>HubSpot's Database Management Study reports that structured cleanup improves data accuracy by 65%.</p>
    
    <h3>Days 31–60: Implementation</h3>
    
    <p>Once your plan is set, it's time to get your hands dirty.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Remove Duplicates</strong> – Use tools or CRM filters to merge or delete redundant records.</li>
      <li><strong>Standardize Fields</strong> – Normalize naming conventions, dropdowns, and formatting.</li>
      <li><strong>Enrich Critical Data</strong> – Add missing company info, contacts, or engagement history.</li>
      <li><strong>Update Processes</strong> – Refine how leads are entered, updated, and categorized.</li>
      <li><strong>Train Team Members</strong> – Ensure everyone follows the new structure and policies.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This is also the perfect time to improve your <a href="/insights/data-enrichment-strategy">data enrichment strategy</a> and ensure new data entering your system meets quality standards.</p>
    
    <p>Gartner's CRM Research finds that systematic cleanup reduces operational costs by 30%.</p>
    
    <h3>Days 61–90: Optimization</h3>
    
    <p>With a cleaner system, your goal now is to maintain and optimize.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Monitor Compliance</strong> – Regularly check adherence to governance rules.</li>
      <li><strong>Refine Processes</strong> – Identify gaps or inefficiencies and adjust workflows.</li>
      <li><strong>Document Procedures</strong> – Create a CRM playbook for onboarding and consistency.</li>
      <li><strong>Train New Users</strong> – Incorporate CRM training into your new-hire process.</li>
      <li><strong>Implement Automation</strong> – Use automation for deduplication, lead routing, and alerts.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Clean CRM data is essential for accurate <a href="/insights/customer-acquisition-cost">customer acquisition cost calculations</a> and effective customer lifecycle tracking.</p>
    
    <p>Forrester's CRM Management Report shows that clean CRMs improve team productivity by 42%. Additionally, SiriusDecisions' Sales Operations Study indicates that proper CRM maintenance reduces data decay by 55%.</p>
    
    <p>For companies implementing comprehensive <a href="/insights/marketing-operations-isnt-it">marketing operations</a> strategies, clean CRM data serves as the foundation for all downstream processes and reporting.</p>
    
    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
    
    <p>A 90-day CRM cleanup isn't just a one-time project—it's the start of a culture of data excellence. A clean, accurate CRM gives your sales and marketing teams the power to make confident, data-driven decisions.</p>
