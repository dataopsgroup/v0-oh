    <p>"Our sales and marketing teams are aligned."</p>
    
    <p>I hear this claim from nearly every executive I work with, yet their data tells a completely different story.</p>
    
    <p>According to Forrester Research, 79% of organizations suffer from critical misalignment between sales and marketing data—even when leadership believes teams are working in harmony.</p>
    
    <p>This invisible divide is costly. LinkedIn's B2B Institute found that companies with strong sales and marketing alignment achieve 38% higher sales win rates and 36% higher customer retention. For a mid-market company, this alignment gap typically translates to millions in lost revenue opportunity.</p>
    
    <p>But alignment isn't about team building exercises or shared happy hours. SiriusDecisions revealed that the root cause lies in fragmented data systems: 67% of companies operate with separate reporting systems for sales and marketing, creating fundamentally different views of the customer journey.</p>
    
    <p>The symptoms are unmistakable:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Marketing celebrates lead volume while sales complains about quality.</li>
      <li>Sales claims certain channels perform best based on anecdotes, while marketing data suggests otherwise.</li>
      <li>Customer acquisition cost calculations differ wildly between departments.</li>
      <li>Both teams take credit for the same wins while blaming each other for losses.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The most problematic finding comes from Gartner, which discovered that even companies with unified CRM systems still suffer from this divide because they lack unified definitions. When Gartner analyzed 400+ organizations, they found an average of 94 data discrepancies between sales and marketing reporting—primarily around lead status definitions, attribution models, and pipeline stage criteria.</p>
    
    <p>Our Unified View Reporting Suite addresses these challenges by creating a single source of truth that tracks the customer journey from stranger to customer. Our approach brings together marketing engagement data, sales activity metrics, and revenue outcomes in one transparent view that builds trust between departments.</p>
