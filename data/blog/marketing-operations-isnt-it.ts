    <p>Marketing Operations is often mistaken for an IT function, leading to misaligned expectations and inefficient resource allocation. Understanding the distinction is crucial for organizational success.</p>
    
    <p>According to Gartner's Marketing Organization Survey, 76% of marketing organizations have dedicated marketing operations teams, yet confusion about their role persists. While there's some overlap with IT, Marketing Operations serves a distinct purpose.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Differences</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Focus</strong>: Marketing Ops concentrates on revenue generation and customer engagement; IT on infrastructure and security.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Metrics</strong>: Marketing Ops tracks campaign performance and ROI; IT monitors system uptime and security.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Tools</strong>: Marketing Ops manages marketing automation and CRM; IT handles network and enterprise systems.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Skills</strong>: Marketing Ops requires marketing strategy knowledge; IT needs technical engineering expertise.</p>
    
    <p>Research from Forrester's Marketing Operations Report shows organizations with clearly defined Marketing Operations roles see 15-25% improvement in marketing effectiveness. The key is establishing clear boundaries:</p>
    
    <h2>Marketing Operations Owns</h2>
    
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Campaign execution and optimization</strong>: Employing tactics like automated lead scoring to improve funnel performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Marketing data quality and governance</strong>: Regularly auditing contact records to reduce duplicates and improve segmentation.</li>
      <li><strong>Marketing technology stack management</strong>: Continuously evaluating new automation tools and ensuring they integrate with existing systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Performance reporting and analytics</strong>: Creating dashboards to monitor return on ad spend and overall ROI for leadership teams.</li>
      <li><strong>Process optimization and workflow design</strong>: Standardizing campaign launch protocols to reduce turnaround times and minimize errors.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>IT provides support but shouldn't drive marketing technology decisions. According to SiriusDecisions' State of B2B Marketing Operations, marketing organizations that maintain control of their tech stack are twice as likely to exceed revenue goals.</p>
    
    <p>Understanding the distinct roles of Marketing Operations and IT is essential for maximizing marketing effectiveness. By clearly defining responsibilities and maintaining control over the marketing tech stack, organizations can enhance revenue generation and customer engagement, ultimately achieving better alignment and improved performance.</p>
