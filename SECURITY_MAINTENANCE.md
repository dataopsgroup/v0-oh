# Security Maintenance Guide

## Monthly Security Tasks (1st of each month)

### Dependency Security
- [ ] Run `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Run `npm audit fix` to auto-fix issues where possible
- [ ] Review `npm audit` report for manual fixes needed
- [ ] Update critical security patches immediately

### Build & Deploy Checks
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to ensure no build issues
- [ ] Test critical user flows (assessment, contact forms)
- [ ] Verify all external links and integrations work
- [ ] Check that environment variables are properly secured

## Before Each Deployment

### Pre-Deploy Checklist
- [ ] Run `npm audit` and resolve any HIGH/CRITICAL issues
- [ ] Run `npm run build` successfully
- [ ] Test assessment functionality
- [ ] Verify contact forms work
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Validate SEO meta tags and structured data

### Security Verification
- [ ] Ensure no sensitive data in client-side code
- [ ] Verify proper HTTPS configuration
- [ ] Check that API endpoints (if any) are secured
- [ ] Validate form input sanitization

## Quarterly Security Reviews

### Dependency Management
- [ ] Review and update major version dependencies
- [ ] Audit development dependencies for security
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies (like we just did!)
- [ ] Update Node.js version if needed

### Code Security Audit
- [ ] Review client-side data handling
- [ ] Check for XSS vulnerabilities in dynamic content
- [ ] Validate form submissions and user inputs
- [ ] Review third-party integrations (Google Forms, etc.)

### Infrastructure Security
- [ ] Review Vercel deployment settings
- [ ] Check domain and SSL certificate status
- [ ] Audit environment variables and secrets
- [ ] Review access controls and permissions

## Emergency Security Response

### Critical Vulnerability Process
1. **Immediate Assessment**
   - Determine if vulnerability affects production
   - Check if sensitive data is at risk
   - Assess impact on user data/privacy

2. **Rapid Response**
   - Apply security patches immediately
   - Test fixes in development first if possible
   - Deploy emergency fixes ASAP
   - Document the incident and response

3. **Post-Incident**
   - Review what caused the vulnerability
   - Update security practices if needed
   - Consider additional monitoring/alerts

## Security Best Practices for This Project

### Content Security
- Keep blog content and case studies free of sensitive client data
- Sanitize any user-generated content (assessment responses)
- Regularly review and update privacy policy

### Technical Security
- Keep Next.js and React updated to latest stable versions
- Use TypeScript for better code safety
- Implement proper error handling to avoid information leakage
- Regular security headers review (CSP, HSTS, etc.)

### Monitoring
- Monitor for unusual traffic patterns
- Set up alerts for failed deployments
- Track and investigate any form submission anomalies
